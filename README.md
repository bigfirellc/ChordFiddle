# ChordFiddle

## [martijnversluis.github.io/ChordFiddle](https://martijnversluis.github.io/ChordFiddle/)

ChordFiddle is an online playground for ChordPro chord sheets. It currently supports:

- editing your ChordPro file
- translating to normal chords sheets
- transposing the ChordPro sheet up and down

On the [project board](https://github.com/martijnversluis/ChordFiddle/projects/1) you can find future features.

Technically speaking ChordFiddle is just a user interface to [ChordSheetJS](https://github.com/martijnversluis/ChordSheetJS).
